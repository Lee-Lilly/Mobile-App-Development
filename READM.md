Self-evaluation

For excercise, I tried my best to make each app work.

ALso, followed instruction carefully, understood each step.

I have some knowledge of React and JSX before this course, it still take time to learn ReactNative and related libraries.

As a very beginner of mobile developement, I have to make effort to set up environment and play around.

I am impressed by Vue, the code seems very neat to me. I would look at this deeper later.

Also PWA work flow is easy to follow and implement.
